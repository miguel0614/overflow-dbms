## About

This repository is a collection of files to create and interact with a StackOverflow database. 

Data was taken from: https://ia800107.us.archive.org/view_archive.php?archive=/27/items/stackexchange/mathoverflow.net.7z

Requires the libraries pandas and BeautifulSoup to create and load the database.
Depending on the OS and BeautifulSoup libraries, the XML may need to use all lowercase instead of camelCase to access the tags.
